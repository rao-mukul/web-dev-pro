// This and Context in JS : Run the Following code in Bowser Console
function testOne() {

// In the Bowser this is the Context because we are in the Window of Browser
// It doesn't print Window here in Node.js as there's no browser here

const testTwo = () => {
  console.log(this);
};
// testTwo(); // Arrow Function still prints the Window Object in Browser
// Therefore, Arrow Function do have the this context âœ…
// So, the whole theory that Arrow functions don't have the this context is not true actually

// Arrow Function do have the Ability to reach out the this context
// But It doesn't have the ability to Pass on this context anywhere

// Eg: When we go into the DOM (Document Object Model):
// We can not use Arrow Functions when we try to access any Element on the Web
// We have to use the Classic Functions

// The Whole Reason Behind them is :
// That there is not enough ability in this in the Arrow Function
// It is there but the ability to just pass it on this is not there

// As it is a method which accepts further a function as it's parameter

// is an example of Higher order function

// ðŸ‘‰Lexical Scoping: In JavaScript, functions have access to variables declared in their outer scopes. This means that inner functions can "see" and use variables declared in their parent functions, and so on up the scope chain.

// ðŸ‘‰Closures, on the other hand, are a result of this lexical scoping when functions "remember" the scope they were defined in, even after the outer function has finished executing.

// Another Simple Example of Lexical Scoping:
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms a ðŸ‘‰closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
// init();
