// This and Context in JS : Run the Following code in Bowser Console
function testOne() {
  console.log(this);
}
// testOne(); // prints the Window Object in Browser
// In the Bowser this is the Context because we are in the Window of Browser
// It doesn't print Window here in Node.js as there's no browser here

const testTwo = () => {
  console.log(this);
};
// testTwo(); // Arrow Function still prints the Window Object in Browser
// Therefore, Arrow Function do have the this context âœ…
// So, the whole theory that Arrow functions don't have the this context is not true actually

// Arrow Function do have the Ability to reach out the this context
// But It doesn't have the ability to Pass on this context anywhere

// Eg: When we go into the DOM (Document Object Model):
// We can not use Arrow Functions when we try to access any Element on the Web
// We have to use the Classic Functions

// The Whole Reason Behind them is :
// That there is not enough ability in this in the Arrow Function
// It is there but the ability to just pass it on this is not there

// These are Higher Order Functions
// Also reffered as First-class Function in MDN docs
// A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

// forEach loop is also an example of Higher Order Function:
// As it is a method which accepts further a function as it's parameter

// ðŸ‘‰ Anything that takes function as a parameter or returns a function back
// is an example of Higher order function
